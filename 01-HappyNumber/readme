Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the square of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1(Happy Number), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which doesn't include 1.

Example:
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
